# This project was made for managing a Coffee Shop. 
  Customers can be added. Each customer has a name, order ID (which is generated randomly) and an order. The order can be either a cappuccino or a cold brew. In case of a cappuccino order, it has a size (small, medium, large) and can be iced or not and in the case of cold brew, it can have toppings (chocolate, vanilla, caramel) and can have milk or not.\
  The project provides a menu, where customers can be added, removed (by name or by orderID), filtered (by their order), displayed and actions can be undone and redone.
